## 🧠 About the Project
This project explores the application of **Machine Learning** techniques to analyze and predict crime patterns in the city of Chicago. It aims to support data-driven decision-making in public safety and urban management.

The study includes:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning of large-scale crime datasets.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover spatial and temporal trends.
- Clustering and predictive modeling using **K-Means** and **Random Forest**.
- Time-series analysis to understand crime evolution over time.
- Development of an **interactive dashboard** with Plotly Dash.

> This project demonstrates how AI and data analytics can help identify high-risk areas, improve resource allocation, and enhance urban security strategies.
